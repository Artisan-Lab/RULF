<!--
Thank you for filing a bug report! 🐛 Please provide a short summary of the bug,
along with any information you feel relevant to replicating the bug.

If you cannot produce a minimal reproduction case (something that would work in
isolation), please provide the steps or even link to a repository that causes
the problematic output to occur.
-->

Given the following code: <!-- Please provide a link to play.rust-lang.org -->

```rust
<code>
```

The current output is:

```
<rustc output>
```

<!-- The following is not always necessary. -->
Ideally the output should look like:

```
<proposed output>
```

<!--
If the problem is not self-explanatory, please provide a rationale for the
change.
-->

<!--
If dramatically different output is caused by small changes, consider also
adding them here.

If you're using the stable version of the compiler, you should also check if the
bug also exists in the beta or nightly versions. The output might also be
different depending on the Edition.
-->
