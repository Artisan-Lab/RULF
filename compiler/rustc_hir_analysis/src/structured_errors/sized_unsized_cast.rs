            "Thin pointers are \"simple\" pointers: they are purely a reference to a
memory address.

Fat pointers are pointers referencing \"Dynamically Sized Types\" (also
called DST). DST don't have a statically known size, therefore they can
only exist behind some kind of pointers that contain additional
information. Slices and trait objects are DSTs. In the case of slices,
the additional information the fat pointer holds is their size.

To fix this error, don't try to cast directly between thin and fat
pointers.
