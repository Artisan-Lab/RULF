/// should never be invoked during a typical compilation session due to performance
/// issues with Polonius.

/// Note:
/// *   This function will panic if the required body was already stolen. This
///     can, for example, happen when requesting a body of a `const` function
///     because they are evaluated during typechecking. The panic can be avoided
///     by overriding the `mir_borrowck` query. You can find a complete example
///     that shows how to do this at `src/test/run-make/obtain-borrowck/`.

/// *   Polonius is highly unstable, so expect regular changes in its signature or other details.
