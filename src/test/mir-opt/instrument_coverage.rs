// Note that the MIR with injected coverage intrinsics includes references to source locations,
// including the source file absolute path. Typically, MIR pretty print output with file
// references are safe because the file prefixes are substituted with `$DIR`, but in this case
// the file references are encoded as function arguments, with an `Operand` type representation
// (`Slice` `Allocation` interned byte array) that cannot be normalized by simple substitution.
//
// The first workaround is to use the `SourceMap`-supported `--remap-path-prefix` option; however,
// the implementation of the `--remap-path-prefix` option currently joins the new prefix and the
// remaining source path with an OS-specific path separator (`\` on Windows). This difference still
// shows up in the byte array representation of the path, causing Windows tests to fail to match
// blessed results baselined with a `/` path separator.
//
// Since this `mir-opt` test does not have any significant platform dependencies, other than the
// path separator differences, the final workaround is to disable testing on Windows.
