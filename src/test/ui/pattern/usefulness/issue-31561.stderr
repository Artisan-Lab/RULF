error[E0005]: refutable pattern in local binding: `Thing::Bar` and `Thing::Baz` not covered
  --> $DIR/issue-31561.rs:8:9

LL |     let Thing::Foo(y) = Thing::Foo(1);
   |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ patterns `Thing::Bar` and `Thing::Baz` not covered
   |
   = note: `let` bindings require an "irrefutable pattern", like a `struct` or an `enum` with only one variant
   = note: for more information, visit https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch18-02-refutability.html

   = note: the matched value is of type `Thing`
help: you might want to use `if let` to ignore the variants that aren't matched
