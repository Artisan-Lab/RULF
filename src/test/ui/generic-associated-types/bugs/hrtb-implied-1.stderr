error[E0716]: temporary value dropped while borrowed

   |     -------------------------------------- argument requires that borrow lasts for `'static`
LL | }
   | - temporary value is freed at the end of this statement
   |
note: due to current limitations in the borrow checker, this implies a `'static` lifetime
