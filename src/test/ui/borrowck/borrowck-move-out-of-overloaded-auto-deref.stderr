error[E0507]: cannot move out of an `Rc`
  --> $DIR/borrowck-move-out-of-overloaded-auto-deref.rs:4:14

LL |     let _x = Rc::new(vec![1, 2]).into_iter();

   |              |                   value moved due to this method call
   |              move occurs because value has type `Vec<i32>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
   |
note: this function takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves value
