### What it does
Checks for whole number float literals that
cannot be represented as the underlying type without loss.

### Why is this bad?
Rust will silently lose precision during
conversion to a float.

### Example
```
let _: f32 = 16_777_217.0; // 16_777_216.0
```

Use instead:
```
let _: f32 = 16_777_216.0;
let _: f64 = 16_777_217.0;
```
