### What it does
Looks for floating-point expressions that
can be expressed using built-in methods to improve accuracy
at the cost of performance.

### Why is this bad?
Negatively impacts accuracy.

### Example
```
let a = 3f32;
let _ = a.powf(1.0 / 3.0);
let _ = (1.0 + a).ln();
let _ = a.exp() - 1.0;
```

Use instead:
```
let a = 3f32;
let _ = a.cbrt();
let _ = a.ln_1p();
let _ = a.exp_m1();
```
