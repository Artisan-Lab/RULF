### What it does
Checks for negative feature names with prefix `no-` or `not-`

### Why is this bad?
Features are supposed to be additive, and negatively-named features violate it.

### Example
```
[features]
default = []
no-abc = []
not-def = []

```
Use instead:
```
[features]
default = ["abc", "def"]
abc = []
def = []

```
