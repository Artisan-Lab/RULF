### What it does
Checks for invisible Unicode characters in the code.

### Why is this bad?
Having an invisible character in the code makes for all
sorts of April fools, but otherwise is very much frowned upon.

### Example
You don't see it, but there may be a zero-width space or soft hyphen
someÂ­where in this text.
