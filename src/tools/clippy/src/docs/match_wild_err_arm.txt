### What it does
Checks for arm which matches all errors with `Err(_)`
and take drastic actions like `panic!`.

### Why is this bad?
It is generally a bad practice, similar to
catching all exceptions in java with `catch(Exception)`

### Example
```
let x: Result<i32, &str> = Ok(3);
match x {
    Ok(_) => println!("ok"),
    Err(_) => panic!("err"),
}
```
