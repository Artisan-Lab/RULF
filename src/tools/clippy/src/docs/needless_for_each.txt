### What it does
Checks for usage of `for_each` that would be more simply written as a
`for` loop.

### Why is this bad?
`for_each` may be used after applying iterator transformers like
`filter` for better readability and performance. It may also be used to fit a simple
operation on one line.
But when none of these apply, a simple `for` loop is more idiomatic.

### Example
```
let v = vec![0, 1, 2];
v.iter().for_each(|elem| {
    println!("{}", elem);
})
```
Use instead:
```
let v = vec![0, 1, 2];
for elem in v.iter() {
    println!("{}", elem);
}
```
