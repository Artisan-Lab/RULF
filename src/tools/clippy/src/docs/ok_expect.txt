### What it does
Checks for usage of `ok().expect(..)`.

### Why is this bad?
Because you usually call `expect()` on the `Result`
directly to get a better error message.

### Known problems
The error type needs to implement `Debug`

### Example
```
x.ok().expect("why did I do this again?");
```

Use instead:
```
x.expect("why did I do this again?");
```
