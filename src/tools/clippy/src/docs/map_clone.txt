### What it does
Checks for usage of `map(|x| x.clone())` or
dereferencing closures for `Copy` types, on `Iterator` or `Option`,
and suggests `cloned()` or `copied()` instead

### Why is this bad?
Readability, this can be written more concisely

### Example
```
let x = vec![42, 43];
let y = x.iter();
let z = y.map(|i| *i);
```

The correct use would be:

```
let x = vec![42, 43];
let y = x.iter();
let z = y.cloned();
```
