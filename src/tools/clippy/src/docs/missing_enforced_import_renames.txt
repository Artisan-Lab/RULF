### What it does
Checks for imports that do not rename the item as specified
in the `enforce-import-renames` config option.

### Why is this bad?
Consistency is important, if a project has defined import
renames they should be followed. More practically, some item names are too
vague outside of their defining scope this can enforce a more meaningful naming.

### Example
An example clippy.toml configuration:
```
enforced-import-renames = [ { path = "serde_json::Value", rename = "JsonValue" }]
```

```
use serde_json::Value;
```
Use instead:
```
use serde_json::Value as JsonValue;
```
