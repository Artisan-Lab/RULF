### What it does
Checks for wildcard enum matches for a single variant.

### Why is this bad?
New enum variants added by library updates can be missed.

### Known problems
Suggested replacements may not use correct path to enum
if it's not present in the current scope.

### Example
```
match x {
    Foo::A => {},
    Foo::B => {},
    _ => {},
}
```

Use instead:
```
match x {
    Foo::A => {},
    Foo::B => {},
    Foo::C => {},
}
```
