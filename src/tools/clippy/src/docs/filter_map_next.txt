### What it does
Checks for usage of `_.filter_map(_).next()`.

### Why is this bad?
Readability, this can be written more concisely as
`_.find_map(_)`.

### Example
```
 (0..3).filter_map(|x| if x == 2 { Some(x) } else { None }).next();
```
Can be written as

```
 (0..3).find_map(|x| if x == 2 { Some(x) } else { None });
```
