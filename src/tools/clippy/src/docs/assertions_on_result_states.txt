### What it does
Checks for `assert!(r.is_ok())` or `assert!(r.is_err())` calls.

### Why is this bad?
An assertion failure cannot output an useful message of the error.

### Known problems
The suggested replacement decreases the readability of code and log output.

### Example
```
assert!(r.is_ok());
assert!(r.is_err());
```
