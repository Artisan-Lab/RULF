### What it does
Checks for transmutes that can't ever be correct on any
architecture.

### Why is this bad?
It's basically guaranteed to be undefined behavior.

### Known problems
When accessing C, users might want to store pointer
sized objects in `extradata` arguments to save an allocation.

### Example
```
let ptr: *const T = core::intrinsics::transmute('x')
```
