### What it does
Checks for printing on *stdout*. The purpose of this lint
is to catch debugging remnants.

### Why is this bad?
People often print on *stdout* while debugging an
application and might forget to remove those prints afterward.

### Known problems
Only catches `print!` and `println!` calls.

### Example
```
println!("Hello world!");
```
