### What it does
This lint warns about unnecessary type repetitions in trait bounds

### Why is this bad?
Repeating the type for every bound makes the code
less readable than combining the bounds

### Example
```
pub fn foo<T>(t: T) where T: Copy, T: Clone {}
```

Use instead:
```
pub fn foo<T>(t: T) where T: Copy + Clone {}
```
