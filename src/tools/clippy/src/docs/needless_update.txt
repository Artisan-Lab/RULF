### What it does
Checks for needlessly including a base struct on update
when all fields are changed anyway.

This lint is not applied to structs marked with
[non_exhaustive](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/type_system.html).

### Why is this bad?
This will cost resources (because the base has to be
somewhere), and make the code less readable.

### Example
```
Point {
    x: 1,
    y: 1,
    z: 1,
    ..zero_point
};
```

Use instead:
```
// Missing field `z`
Point {
    x: 1,
    y: 1,
    ..zero_point
};
```
