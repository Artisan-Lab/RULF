### What it does
Checks for unnecessary '..' pattern binding on struct when all fields are explicitly matched.

### Why is this bad?
Correctness and readability. It's like having a wildcard pattern after
matching all enum variants explicitly.

### Example
```
let a = A { a: 5 };

match a {
    A { a: 5, .. } => {},
    _ => {},
}
```

Use instead:
```
match a {
    A { a: 5 } => {},
    _ => {},
}
```
