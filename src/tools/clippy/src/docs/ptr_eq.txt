### What it does
Use `std::ptr::eq` when applicable

### Why is this bad?
`ptr::eq` can be used to compare `&T` references
(which coerce to `*const T` implicitly) by their address rather than
comparing the values they point to.

### Example
```
let a = &[1, 2, 3];
let b = &[1, 2, 3];

assert!(a as *const _ as usize == b as *const _ as usize);
```
Use instead:
```
let a = &[1, 2, 3];
let b = &[1, 2, 3];

assert!(std::ptr::eq(a, b));
```
