### What it does
Checks for wildcard pattern used with others patterns in same match arm.

### Why is this bad?
Wildcard pattern already covers any other pattern as it will match anyway.
It makes the code less readable, especially to spot wildcard pattern use in match arm.

### Example
```
match s {
    "a" => {},
    "bar" | _ => {},
}
```

Use instead:
```
match s {
    "a" => {},
    _ => {},
}
```
