### What it does
Checks for fields in struct literals where shorthands
could be used.

### Why is this bad?
If the field and variable names are the same,
the field name is redundant.

### Example
```
let bar: u8 = 123;

struct Foo {
    bar: u8,
}

let foo = Foo { bar: bar };
```
the last line can be simplified to
```
let foo = Foo { bar };
```
