### What it does
Checks for `extern crate` and `use` items annotated with
lint attributes.

This lint permits lint attributes for lints emitted on the items themself.
For `use` items these lints are:
* deprecated
* unreachable_pub
* unused_imports
* clippy::enum_glob_use
* clippy::macro_use_imports
* clippy::wildcard_imports

For `extern crate` items these lints are:
* `unused_imports` on items with `#[macro_use]`

### Why is this bad?
Lint attributes have no effect on crate imports. Most
likely a `!` was forgotten.

### Example
```
#[deny(dead_code)]
extern crate foo;
#[forbid(dead_code)]
use foo::bar;
```

Use instead:
```
#[allow(unused_imports)]
use foo::baz;
#[allow(unused_imports)]
#[macro_use]
extern crate baz;
```
