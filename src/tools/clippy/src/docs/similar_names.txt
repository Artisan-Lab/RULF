### What it does
Checks for names that are very similar and thus confusing.

Note: this lint looks for similar names throughout each
scope. To allow it, you need to allow it on the scope
level, not on the name that is reported.

### Why is this bad?
It's hard to distinguish between names that differ only
by a single character.

### Example
```
let checked_exp = something;
let checked_expr = something_else;
```
