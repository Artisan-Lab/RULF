### What it does
Checks for expressions of the form `x == true`,
`x != true` and order comparisons such as `x < true` (or vice versa) and
suggest using the variable directly.

### Why is this bad?
Unnecessary code.

### Example
```
if x == true {}
if y == false {}
```
use `x` directly:
```
if x {}
if !y {}
```
