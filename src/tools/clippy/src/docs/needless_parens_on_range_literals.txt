### What it does
The lint checks for parenthesis on literals in range statements that are
superfluous.

### Why is this bad?
Having superfluous parenthesis makes the code less readable
overhead when reading.

### Example

```
for i in (0)..10 {
  println!("{i}");
}
```

Use instead:

```
for i in 0..10 {
  println!("{i}");
}
```
