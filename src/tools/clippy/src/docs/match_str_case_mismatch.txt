### What it does
Checks for `match` expressions modifying the case of a string with non-compliant arms

### Why is this bad?
The arm is unreachable, which is likely a mistake

### Example
```
match &*text.to_ascii_lowercase() {
    "foo" => {},
    "Bar" => {},
    _ => {},
}
```
Use instead:
```
match &*text.to_ascii_lowercase() {
    "foo" => {},
    "bar" => {},
    _ => {},
}
```
