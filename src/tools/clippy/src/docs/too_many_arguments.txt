### What it does
Checks for functions with too many parameters.

### Why is this bad?
Functions with lots of parameters are considered bad
style and reduce readability (“what does the 5th parameter mean?”). Consider
grouping some parameters into a new type.

### Example
```
fn foo(x: u32, y: u32, name: &str, c: Color, w: f32, h: f32, a: f32, b: f32) {
    // ..
}
```
