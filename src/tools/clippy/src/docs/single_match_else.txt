### What it does
Checks for matches with two arms where an `if let else` will
usually suffice.

### Why is this bad?
Just readability â€“ `if let` nests less than a `match`.

### Known problems
Personal style preferences may differ.

### Example
Using `match`:

```
match x {
    Some(ref foo) => bar(foo),
    _ => bar(&other_ref),
}
```

Using `if let` with `else`:

```
if let Some(ref foo) = x {
    bar(foo);
} else {
    bar(&other_ref);
}
```
