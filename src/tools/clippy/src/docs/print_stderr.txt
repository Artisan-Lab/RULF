### What it does
Checks for printing on *stderr*. The purpose of this lint
is to catch debugging remnants.

### Why is this bad?
People often print on *stderr* while debugging an
application and might forget to remove those prints afterward.

### Known problems
Only catches `eprint!` and `eprintln!` calls.

### Example
```
eprintln!("Hello world!");
```
