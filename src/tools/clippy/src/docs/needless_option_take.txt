### What it does
Checks for calling `take` function after `as_ref`.

### Why is this bad?
Redundant code. `take` writes `None` to its argument.
In this case the modification is useless as it's a temporary that cannot be read from afterwards.

### Example
```
let x = Some(3);
x.as_ref().take();
```
Use instead:
```
let x = Some(3);
x.as_ref();
```
