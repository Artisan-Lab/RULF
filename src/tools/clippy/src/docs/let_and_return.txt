### What it does
Checks for `let`-bindings, which are subsequently
returned.

### Why is this bad?
It is just extraneous code. Remove it to make your code
more rusty.

### Example
```
fn foo() -> String {
    let x = String::new();
    x
}
```
instead, use
```
fn foo() -> String {
    String::new()
}
```
