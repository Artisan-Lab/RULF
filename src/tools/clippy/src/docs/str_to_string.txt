### What it does
This lint checks for `.to_string()` method calls on values of type `&str`.

### Why is this bad?
The `to_string` method is also used on other types to convert them to a string.
When called on a `&str` it turns the `&str` into the owned variant `String`, which can be better
expressed with `.to_owned()`.

### Example
```
// example code where clippy issues a warning
let _ = "str".to_string();
```
Use instead:
```
// example code which does not raise clippy warning
let _ = "str".to_owned();
```
