### What it does
Warns if there is a better representation for a numeric literal.

### Why is this bad?
Especially for big powers of 2 a hexadecimal representation is more
readable than a decimal representation.

### Example
```
`255` => `0xFF`
`65_535` => `0xFFFF`
`4_042_322_160` => `0xF0F0_F0F0`
```
