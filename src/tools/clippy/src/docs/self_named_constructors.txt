### What it does
Warns when constructors have the same name as their types.

### Why is this bad?
Repeating the name of the type is redundant.

### Example
```
struct Foo {}

impl Foo {
    pub fn foo() -> Foo {
        Foo {}
    }
}
```
Use instead:
```
struct Foo {}

impl Foo {
    pub fn new() -> Foo {
        Foo {}
    }
}
```
