### What it does
Checks for C-like enumerations that are
`repr(isize/usize)` and have values that don't fit into an `i32`.

### Why is this bad?
This will truncate the variant value on 32 bit
architectures, but works fine on 64 bit.

### Example
```
#[repr(usize)]
enum NonPortable {
    X = 0x1_0000_0000,
    Y = 0,
}
```
