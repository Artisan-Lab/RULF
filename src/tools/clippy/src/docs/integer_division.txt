### What it does
Checks for division of integers

### Why is this bad?
When outside of some very specific algorithms,
integer division is very often a mistake because it discards the
remainder.

### Example
```
let x = 3 / 2;
println!("{}", x);
```

Use instead:
```
let x = 3f32 / 2f32;
println!("{}", x);
```
