### What it does
Checks whether partial fields of a struct are public.

Either make all fields of a type public, or make none of them public

### Why is this bad?
Most types should either be:
* Abstract data types: complex objects with opaque implementation which guard
interior invariants and expose intentionally limited API to the outside world.
* Data:â€‰relatively simple objects which group a bunch of related attributes together.

### Example
```
pub struct Color {
    pub r: u8,
    pub g: u8,
    b: u8,
}
```
Use instead:
```
pub struct Color {
    pub r: u8,
    pub g: u8,
    pub b: u8,
}
```
