### What it does
Checks for pattern matchings that can be expressed using equality.

### Why is this bad?

* It reads better and has less cognitive load because equality won't cause binding.
* It is a [Yoda condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda_conditions). Yoda conditions are widely
criticized for increasing the cognitive load of reading the code.
* Equality is a simple bool expression and can be merged with `&&` and `||` and
reuse if blocks

### Example
```
if let Some(2) = x {
    do_thing();
}
```
Use instead:
```
if x == Some(2) {
    do_thing();
}
```
