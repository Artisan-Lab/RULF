### What it does
Detects passing a mutable reference to a function that only
requires an immutable reference.

### Why is this bad?
The mutable reference rules out all other references to
the value. Also the code misleads about the intent of the call site.

### Example
```
vec.push(&mut value);
```

Use instead:
```
vec.push(&value);
```
