### What it does
Checks whether a for loop has a single element.

### Why is this bad?
There is no reason to have a loop of a
single element.

### Example
```
let item1 = 2;
for item in &[item1] {
    println!("{}", item);
}
```

Use instead:
```
let item1 = 2;
let item = &item1;
println!("{}", item);
```
