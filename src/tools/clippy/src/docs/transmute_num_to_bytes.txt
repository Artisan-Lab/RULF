### What it does
Checks for transmutes from a number to an array of `u8`

### Why this is bad?
Transmutes are dangerous and error-prone, whereas `to_ne_bytes`
is intuitive and safe.

### Example
```
unsafe {
    let x: [u8; 8] = std::mem::transmute(1i64);
}

// should be
let x: [u8; 8] = 0i64.to_ne_bytes();
```
