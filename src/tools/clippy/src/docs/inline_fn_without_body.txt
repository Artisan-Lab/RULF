### What it does
Checks for `#[inline]` on trait methods without bodies

### Why is this bad?
Only implementations of trait methods may be inlined.
The inline attribute is ignored for trait methods without bodies.

### Example
```
trait Animal {
    #[inline]
    fn name(&self) -> &'static str;
}
```
