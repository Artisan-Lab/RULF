### What it does
Checks for modulo arithmetic.

### Why is this bad?
The results of modulo (%) operation might differ
depending on the language, when negative numbers are involved.
If you interop with different languages it might be beneficial
to double check all places that use modulo arithmetic.

For example, in Rust `17 % -3 = 2`, but in Python `17 % -3 = -1`.

### Example
```
let x = -17 % 3;
```
