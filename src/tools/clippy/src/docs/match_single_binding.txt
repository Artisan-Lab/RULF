### What it does
Checks for useless match that binds to only one value.

### Why is this bad?
Readability and needless complexity.

### Known problems
 Suggested replacements may be incorrect when `match`
is actually binding temporary value, bringing a 'dropped while borrowed' error.

### Example
```
match (a, b) {
    (c, d) => {
        // useless match
    }
}
```

Use instead:
```
let (c, d) = (a, b);
```
