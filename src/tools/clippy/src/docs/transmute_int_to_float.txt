### What it does
Checks for transmutes from an integer to a float.

### Why is this bad?
Transmutes are dangerous and error-prone, whereas `from_bits` is intuitive
and safe.

### Example
```
unsafe {
    let _: f32 = std::mem::transmute(1_u32); // where x: u32
}

// should be:
let _: f32 = f32::from_bits(1_u32);
```
