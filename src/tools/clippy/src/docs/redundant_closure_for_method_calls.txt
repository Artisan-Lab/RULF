### What it does
Checks for closures which only invoke a method on the closure
argument and can be replaced by referencing the method directly.

### Why is this bad?
It's unnecessary to create the closure.

### Example
```
Some('a').map(|s| s.to_uppercase());
```
may be rewritten as
```
Some('a').map(char::to_uppercase);
```
