### What it does
Checks for calls to `map` followed by a `count`.

### Why is this bad?
It looks suspicious. Maybe `map` was confused with `filter`.
If the `map` call is intentional, this should be rewritten
using `inspect`. Or, if you intend to drive the iterator to
completion, you can just use `for_each` instead.

### Example
```
let _ = (0..3).map(|x| x + 2).count();
```
