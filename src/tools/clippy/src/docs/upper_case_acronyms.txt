### What it does
Checks for fully capitalized names and optionally names containing a capitalized acronym.

### Why is this bad?
In CamelCase, acronyms count as one word.
See [naming conventions](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/naming.html#casing-conforms-to-rfc-430-c-case)
for more.

By default, the lint only triggers on fully-capitalized names.
You can use the `upper-case-acronyms-aggressive: true` config option to enable linting
on all camel case names

### Known problems
When two acronyms are contiguous, the lint can't tell where
the first acronym ends and the second starts, so it suggests to lowercase all of
the letters in the second acronym.

### Example
```
struct HTTPResponse;
```
Use instead:
```
struct HttpResponse;
```
