### What it does
Checks for items annotated with `#[inline(always)]`,
unless the annotated function is empty or simply panics.

### Why is this bad?
While there are valid uses of this annotation (and once
you know when to use it, by all means `allow` this lint), it's a common
newbie-mistake to pepper one's code with it.

As a rule of thumb, before slapping `#[inline(always)]` on a function,
measure if that additional function call really affects your runtime profile
sufficiently to make up for the increase in compile time.

### Known problems
False positives, big time. This lint is meant to be
deactivated by everyone doing serious performance work. This means having
done the measurement.

### Example
```
#[inline(always)]
fn not_quite_hot_code(..) { ... }
```
