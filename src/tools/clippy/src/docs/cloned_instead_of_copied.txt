### What it does
Checks for usages of `cloned()` on an `Iterator` or `Option` where
`copied()` could be used instead.

### Why is this bad?
`copied()` is better because it guarantees that the type being cloned
implements `Copy`.

### Example
```
[1, 2, 3].iter().cloned();
```
Use instead:
```
[1, 2, 3].iter().copied();
```
