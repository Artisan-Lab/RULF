### What it does
Checks that common macros are used with consistent bracing.

### Why is this bad?
This is mostly a consistency lint although using () or []
doesn't give you a semicolon in item position, which can be unexpected.

### Example
```
vec!{1, 2, 3};
```
Use instead:
```
vec![1, 2, 3];
```
