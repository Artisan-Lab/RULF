### What it does
Checks for imports ending in `::{self}`.

### Why is this bad?
In most cases, this can be written much more cleanly by omitting `::{self}`.

### Known problems
Removing `::{self}` will cause any non-module items at the same path to also be imported.
This might cause a naming conflict (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/3568). This lint makes no attempt
to detect this scenario and that is why it is a restriction lint.

### Example
```
use std::io::{self};
```
Use instead:
```
use std::io;
```
