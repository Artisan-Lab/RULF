### What it does
Checks for transmutes between a type `T` and `*T`.

### Why is this bad?
It's easy to mistakenly transmute between a type and a
pointer to that type.

### Example
```
core::intrinsics::transmute(t) // where the result type is the same as
                               // `*t` or `&t`'s
```
