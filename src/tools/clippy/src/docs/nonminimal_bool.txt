### What it does
Checks for boolean expressions that can be written more
concisely.

### Why is this bad?
Readability of boolean expressions suffers from
unnecessary duplication.

### Known problems
Ignores short circuiting behavior of `||` and
`&&`. Ignores `|`, `&` and `^`.

### Example
```
if a && true {}
if !(a == b) {}
```

Use instead:
```
if a {}
if a != b {}
```
