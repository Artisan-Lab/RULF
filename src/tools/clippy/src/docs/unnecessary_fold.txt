### What it does
Checks for using `fold` when a more succinct alternative exists.
Specifically, this checks for `fold`s which could be replaced by `any`, `all`,
`sum` or `product`.

### Why is this bad?
Readability.

### Example
```
(0..3).fold(false, |acc, x| acc || x > 2);
```

Use instead:
```
(0..3).any(|x| x > 2);
```
