### What it does
Checks for `else` blocks that can be removed without changing semantics.

### Why is this bad?
The `else` block adds unnecessary indentation and verbosity.

### Known problems
Some may prefer to keep the `else` block for clarity.

### Example
```
fn my_func(count: u32) {
    if count == 0 {
        print!("Nothing to do");
        return;
    } else {
        print!("Moving on...");
    }
}
```
Use instead:
```
fn my_func(count: u32) {
    if count == 0 {
        print!("Nothing to do");
        return;
    }
    print!("Moving on...");
}
```
