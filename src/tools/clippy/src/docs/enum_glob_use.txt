### What it does
Checks for `use Enum::*`.

### Why is this bad?
It is usually better style to use the prefixed name of
an enumeration variant, rather than importing variants.

### Known problems
Old-style enumerations that prefix the variants are
still around.

### Example
```
use std::cmp::Ordering::*;

foo(Less);
```

Use instead:
```
use std::cmp::Ordering;

foo(Ordering::Less)
```
