### What it does
Detects the syntax `['foo']` in documentation comments (notice quotes instead of backticks)
outside of code blocks
### Why is this bad?
It is likely a typo when defining an intra-doc link

### Example
```
/// See also: ['foo']
fn bar() {}
```
Use instead:
```
/// See also: [`foo`]
fn bar() {}
```
