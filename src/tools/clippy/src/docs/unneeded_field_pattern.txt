### What it does
Checks for structure field patterns bound to wildcards.

### Why is this bad?
Using `..` instead is shorter and leaves the focus on
the fields that are actually bound.

### Example
```
let f = Foo { a: 0, b: 0, c: 0 };

match f {
    Foo { a: _, b: 0, .. } => {},
    Foo { a: _, b: _, c: _ } => {},
}
```

Use instead:
```
let f = Foo { a: 0, b: 0, c: 0 };

match f {
    Foo { b: 0, .. } => {},
    Foo { .. } => {},
}
```
