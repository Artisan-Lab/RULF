### What it does

Restricts the usage of `pub use ...`

### Why is this bad?

`pub use` is usually fine, but a project may wish to limit `pub use` instances to prevent
unintentional exports or to encourage placing exported items directly in public modules

### Example
```
pub mod outer {
    mod inner {
        pub struct Test {}
    }
    pub use inner::Test;
}

use outer::Test;
```
Use instead:
```
pub mod outer {
    pub struct Test {}
}

use outer::Test;
```
