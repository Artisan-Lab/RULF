### What it does
Checks for usage of `.chars().next()` on a `str` to check
if it starts with a given char.

### Why is this bad?
Readability, this can be written more concisely as
`_.starts_with(_)`.

### Example
```
let name = "foo";
if name.chars().next() == Some('_') {};
```

Use instead:
```
let name = "foo";
if name.starts_with('_') {};
```
