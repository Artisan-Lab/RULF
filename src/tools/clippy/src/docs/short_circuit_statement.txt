### What it does
Checks for the use of short circuit boolean conditions as
a
statement.

### Why is this bad?
Using a short circuit boolean condition as a statement
may hide the fact that the second part is executed or not depending on the
outcome of the first part.

### Example
```
f() && g(); // We should write `if f() { g(); }`.
```
