### What it does
Checks for consecutive `if`s with the same condition.

### Why is this bad?
This is probably a copy & paste error.

### Example
```
if a == b {
    …
} else if a == b {
    …
}
```

Note that this lint ignores all conditions with a function call as it could
have side effects:

```
if foo() {
    …
} else if foo() { // not linted
    …
}
```
