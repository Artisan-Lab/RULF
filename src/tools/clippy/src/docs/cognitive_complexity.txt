### What it does
Checks for methods with high cognitive complexity.

### Why is this bad?
Methods of high cognitive complexity tend to be hard to
both read and maintain. Also LLVM will tend to optimize small methods better.

### Known problems
Sometimes it's hard to find a way to reduce the
complexity.

### Example
You'll see it when you get the warning.
