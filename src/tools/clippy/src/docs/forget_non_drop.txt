### What it does
Checks for calls to `std::mem::forget` with a value that does not implement `Drop`.

### Why is this bad?
Calling `std::mem::forget` is no different than dropping such a type. A different value may
have been intended.

### Example
```
struct Foo;
let x = Foo;
std::mem::forget(x);
```
