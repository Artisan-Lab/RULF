### What it does
Checks for the inclusion of large files via `include_bytes!()`
and `include_str!()`

### Why is this bad?
Including large files can increase the size of the binary

### Example
```
let included_str = include_str!("very_large_file.txt");
let included_bytes = include_bytes!("very_large_file.txt");
```

Use instead:
```
use std::fs;

// You can load the file at runtime
let string = fs::read_to_string("very_large_file.txt")?;
let bytes = fs::read("very_large_file.txt")?;
```
