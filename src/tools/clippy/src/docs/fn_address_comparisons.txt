### What it does
Checks for comparisons with an address of a function item.

### Why is this bad?
Function item address is not guaranteed to be unique and could vary
between different code generation units. Furthermore different function items could have
the same address after being merged together.

### Example
```
type F = fn();
fn a() {}
let f: F = a;
if f == a {
    // ...
}
```
