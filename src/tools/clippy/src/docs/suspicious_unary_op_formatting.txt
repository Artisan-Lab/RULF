### What it does
Checks the formatting of a unary operator on the right hand side
of a binary operator. It lints if there is no space between the binary and unary operators,
but there is a space between the unary and its operand.

### Why is this bad?
This is either a typo in the binary operator or confusing.

### Example
```
// &&! looks like a different operator
if foo &&! bar {}
```

Use instead:
```
if foo && !bar {}
```
