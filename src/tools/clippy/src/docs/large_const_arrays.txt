### What it does
Checks for large `const` arrays that should
be defined as `static` instead.

### Why is this bad?
Performance: const variables are inlined upon use.
Static items result in only one instance and has a fixed location in memory.

### Example
```
pub const a = [0u32; 1_000_000];
```

Use instead:
```
pub static a = [0u32; 1_000_000];
```
