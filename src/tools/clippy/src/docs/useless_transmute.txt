### What it does
Checks for transmutes to the original type of the object
and transmutes that could be a cast.

### Why is this bad?
Readability. The code tricks people into thinking that
something complex is going on.

### Example
```
core::intrinsics::transmute(t); // where the result type is the same as `t`'s
```
