### What it does
Searches for implementations of the `Into<..>` trait and suggests to implement `From<..>` instead.

### Why is this bad?
According the std docs implementing `From<..>` is preferred since it gives you `Into<..>` for free where the reverse isn't true.

### Example
```
struct StringWrapper(String);

impl Into<StringWrapper> for String {
    fn into(self) -> StringWrapper {
        StringWrapper(self)
    }
}
```
Use instead:
```
struct StringWrapper(String);

impl From<String> for StringWrapper {
    fn from(s: String) -> StringWrapper {
        StringWrapper(s)
    }
}
```
