### What it does
Checks for boolean expressions that contain terminals that
can be eliminated.

### Why is this bad?
This is most likely a logic bug.

### Known problems
Ignores short circuiting behavior.

### Example
```
// The `b` is unnecessary, the expression is equivalent to `if a`.
if a && b || a { ... }
```

Use instead:
```
if a {}
```
