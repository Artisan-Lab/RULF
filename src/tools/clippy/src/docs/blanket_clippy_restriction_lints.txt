### What it does
Checks for `warn`/`deny`/`forbid` attributes targeting the whole clippy::restriction category.

### Why is this bad?
Restriction lints sometimes are in contrast with other lints or even go against idiomatic rust.
These lints should only be enabled on a lint-by-lint basis and with careful consideration.

### Example
```
#![deny(clippy::restriction)]
```

Use instead:
```
#![deny(clippy::as_conversions)]
```
