### What it does
Checks for matches where match expression is a `bool`. It
suggests to replace the expression with an `if...else` block.

### Why is this bad?
It makes the code less readable.

### Example
```
let condition: bool = true;
match condition {
    true => foo(),
    false => bar(),
}
```
Use if/else instead:
```
let condition: bool = true;
if condition {
    foo();
} else {
    bar();
}
```
