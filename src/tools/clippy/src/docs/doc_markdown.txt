### What it does
Checks for the presence of `_`, `::` or camel-case words
outside ticks in documentation.

### Why is this bad?
*Rustdoc* supports markdown formatting, `_`, `::` and
camel-case probably indicates some code which should be included between
ticks. `_` can also be used for emphasis in markdown, this lint tries to
consider that.

### Known problems
Lots of bad docs wonâ€™t be fixed, what the lint checks
for is limited, and there are still false positives. HTML elements and their
content are not linted.

In addition, when writing documentation comments, including `[]` brackets
inside a link text would trip the parser. Therefore, documenting link with
`[`SmallVec<[T; INLINE_CAPACITY]>`]` and then [`SmallVec<[T; INLINE_CAPACITY]>`]: SmallVec
would fail.

### Examples
```
/// Do something with the foo_bar parameter. See also
/// that::other::module::foo.
// ^ `foo_bar` and `that::other::module::foo` should be ticked.
fn doit(foo_bar: usize) {}
```

```
// Link text with `[]` brackets should be written as following:
/// Consume the array and return the inner
/// [`SmallVec<[T; INLINE_CAPACITY]>`][SmallVec].
/// [SmallVec]: SmallVec
fn main() {}
```
