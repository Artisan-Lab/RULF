### What it does

Detects cases where a whole-number literal float is being rounded, using
the `floor`, `ceil`, or `round` methods.

### Why is this bad?

This is unnecessary and confusing to the reader. Doing this is probably a mistake.

### Example
```
let x = 1f32.ceil();
```
Use instead:
```
let x = 1f32;
```
