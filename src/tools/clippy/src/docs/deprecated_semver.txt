### What it does
Checks for `#[deprecated]` annotations with a `since`
field that is not a valid semantic version.

### Why is this bad?
For checking the version of the deprecation, it must be
a valid semver. Failing that, the contained information is useless.

### Example
```
#[deprecated(since = "forever")]
fn something_else() { /* ... */ }
```
