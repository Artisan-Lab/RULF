### What it does
Checks for looping over the range of `0..len` of some
collection just to get the values by index.

### Why is this bad?
Just iterating the collection itself makes the intent
more clear and is probably faster.

### Example
```
let vec = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];
for i in 0..vec.len() {
    println!("{}", vec[i]);
}
```

Use instead:
```
let vec = vec!['a', 'b', 'c'];
for i in vec {
    println!("{}", i);
}
```
