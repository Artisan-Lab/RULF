### What it does
Checks for functions with a large amount of lines.

### Why is this bad?
Functions with a lot of lines are harder to understand
due to having to look at a larger amount of code to understand what the
function is doing. Consider splitting the body of the function into
multiple functions.

### Example
```
fn im_too_long() {
    println!("");
    // ... 100 more LoC
    println!("");
}
```
