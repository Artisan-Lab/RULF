### What it does

Finds items imported through `std` when available through `alloc`.

### Why is this bad?

Crates which have `no_std` compatibility and require alloc may wish to ensure types are imported from
alloc to ensure disabling `std` does not cause the crate to fail to compile. This lint is also useful
for crates migrating to become `no_std` compatible.

### Example
```
use std::vec::Vec;
```
Use instead:
```
use alloc::vec::Vec;
```
