### What it does
Checks for for-loops that manually copy items between
slices that could be optimized by having a memcpy.

### Why is this bad?
It is not as fast as a memcpy.

### Example
```
for i in 0..src.len() {
    dst[i + 64] = src[i];
}
```

Use instead:
```
dst[64..(src.len() + 64)].clone_from_slice(&src[..]);
```
