### What it does
Checks for comparisons to unit. This includes all binary
comparisons (like `==` and `<`) and asserts.

### Why is this bad?
Unit is always equal to itself, and thus is just a
clumsily written constant. Mostly this happens when someone accidentally
adds semicolons at the end of the operands.

### Example
```
if {
    foo();
} == {
    bar();
} {
    baz();
}
```
is equal to
```
{
    foo();
    bar();
    baz();
}
```

For asserts:
```
assert_eq!({ foo(); }, { bar(); });
```
will always succeed
