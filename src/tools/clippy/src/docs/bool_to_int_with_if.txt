### What it does
Instead of using an if statement to convert a bool to an int,
this lint suggests using a `from()` function or an `as` coercion.

### Why is this bad?
Coercion or `from()` is idiomatic way to convert bool to a number.
Both methods are guaranteed to return 1 for true, and 0 for false.

See https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.bool.html#impl-From%3Cbool%3E

### Example
```
if condition {
    1_i64
} else {
    0
};
```
Use instead:
```
i64::from(condition);
```
or
```
condition as i64;
```
