### What it does
Checks for slicing expressions which are equivalent to dereferencing the
value.

### Why is this bad?
Some people may prefer to dereference rather than slice.

### Example
```
let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
let slice = &vec[..];
```
Use instead:
```
let vec = vec![1, 2, 3];
let slice = &*vec;
```
