### What it does
Checks for wildcard enum matches using `_`.

### Why is this bad?
New enum variants added by library updates can be missed.

### Known problems
Suggested replacements may be incorrect if guards exhaustively cover some
variants, and also may not use correct path to enum if it's not present in the current scope.

### Example
```
match x {
    Foo::A(_) => {},
    _ => {},
}
```

Use instead:
```
match x {
    Foo::A(_) => {},
    Foo::B(_) => {},
}
```
