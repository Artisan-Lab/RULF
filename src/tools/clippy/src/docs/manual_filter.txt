### What it does
Checks for usages of `match` which could be implemented using `filter`

### Why is this bad?
Using the `filter` method is clearer and more concise.

### Example
```
match Some(0) {
    Some(x) => if x % 2 == 0 {
                    Some(x)
               } else {
                    None
                },
    None => None,
};
```
Use instead:
```
Some(0).filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0);
```
