### What it does
Checks for uses of the `abs()` method that cast the result to unsigned.

### Why is this bad?
The `unsigned_abs()` method avoids panic when called on the MIN value.

### Example
```
let x: i32 = -42;
let y: u32 = x.abs() as u32;
```
Use instead:
```
let x: i32 = -42;
let y: u32 = x.unsigned_abs();
```
