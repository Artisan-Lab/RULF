### What it does
Checks for iteration that may be infinite.

### Why is this bad?
While there may be places where this is acceptable
(e.g., in event streams), in most cases this is simply an error.

### Known problems
The code may have a condition to stop iteration, but
this lint is not clever enough to analyze it.

### Example
```
let infinite_iter = 0..;
[0..].iter().zip(infinite_iter.take_while(|x| *x > 5));
```
