### What it does
Checks for expressions of the form `if c { true } else {
false }` (or vice versa) and suggests using the condition directly.

### Why is this bad?
Redundant code.

### Known problems
Maybe false positives: Sometimes, the two branches are
painstakingly documented (which we, of course, do not detect), so they *may*
have some value. Even then, the documentation can be rewritten to match the
shorter code.

### Example
```
if x {
    false
} else {
    true
}
```

Use instead:
```
!x
```
