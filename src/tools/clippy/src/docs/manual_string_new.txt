### What it does

Checks for usage of `""` to create a `String`, such as `"".to_string()`, `"".to_owned()`,
`String::from("")` and others.

### Why is this bad?

Different ways of creating an empty string makes your code less standardized, which can
be confusing.

### Example
```
let a = "".to_string();
let b: String = "".into();
```
Use instead:
```
let a = String::new();
let b = String::new();
```
