### What it does
Checks for imports that remove "unsafe" from an item's
name.

### Why is this bad?
Renaming makes it less clear which traits and
structures are unsafe.

### Example
```
use std::cell::{UnsafeCell as TotallySafeCell};

extern crate crossbeam;
use crossbeam::{spawn_unsafe as spawn};
```
