### What it does
Checks for tuple patterns with a wildcard
pattern (`_`) is next to a rest pattern (`..`).

_NOTE_: While `_, ..` means there is at least one element left, `..`
means there are 0 or more elements left. This can make a difference
when refactoring, but shouldn't result in errors in the refactored code,
since the wildcard pattern isn't used anyway.

### Why is this bad?
The wildcard pattern is unneeded as the rest pattern
can match that element as well.

### Example
```
match t {
    TupleStruct(0, .., _) => (),
    _ => (),
}
```

Use instead:
```
match t {
    TupleStruct(0, ..) => (),
    _ => (),
}
```
