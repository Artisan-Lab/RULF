### What it does
Checks for multiple inherent implementations of a struct

### Why is this bad?
Splitting the implementation of a type makes the code harder to navigate.

### Example
```
struct X;
impl X {
    fn one() {}
}
impl X {
    fn other() {}
}
```

Could be written:

```
struct X;
impl X {
    fn one() {}
    fn other() {}
}
```
