### What it does
Checks for usages of `.then_some(..).unwrap_or(..)`

### Why is this bad?
This can be written more clearly with `if .. else ..`

### Limitations
This lint currently only looks for usages of
`.then_some(..).unwrap_or(..)`, but will be expanded
to account for similar patterns.

### Example
```
let x = true;
x.then_some("a").unwrap_or("b");
```
Use instead:
```
let x = true;
if x { "a" } else { "b" };
```
