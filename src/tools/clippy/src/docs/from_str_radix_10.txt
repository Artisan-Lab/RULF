### What it does

Checks for function invocations of the form `primitive::from_str_radix(s, 10)`

### Why is this bad?

This specific common use case can be rewritten as `s.parse::<primitive>()`
(and in most cases, the turbofish can be removed), which reduces code length
and complexity.

### Known problems

This lint may suggest using (&<expression>).parse() instead of <expression>.parse() directly
in some cases, which is correct but adds unnecessary complexity to the code.

### Example
```
let input: &str = get_input();
let num = u16::from_str_radix(input, 10)?;
```
Use instead:
```
let input: &str = get_input();
let num: u16 = input.parse()?;
```
