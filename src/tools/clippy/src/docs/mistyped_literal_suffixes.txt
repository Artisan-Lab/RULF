### What it does
Warns for mistyped suffix in literals

### Why is this bad?
This is most probably a typo

### Known problems
- Does not match on integers too large to fit in the corresponding unsigned type
- Does not match on `_127` since that is a valid grouping for decimal and octal numbers

### Example
```
`2_32` => `2_i32`
`250_8 => `250_u8`
```
