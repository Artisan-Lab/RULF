### What it does
Checks for conversions to owned values just for the sake
of a comparison.

### Why is this bad?
The comparison can operate on a reference, so creating
an owned value effectively throws it away directly afterwards, which is
needlessly consuming code and heap space.

### Example
```
if x.to_owned() == y {}
```

Use instead:
```
if x == y {}
```
