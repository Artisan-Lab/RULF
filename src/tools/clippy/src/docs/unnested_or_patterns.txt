### What it does
Checks for unnested or-patterns, e.g., `Some(0) | Some(2)` and
suggests replacing the pattern with a nested one, `Some(0 | 2)`.

Another way to think of this is that it rewrites patterns in
*disjunctive normal form (DNF)* into *conjunctive normal form (CNF)*.

### Why is this bad?
In the example above, `Some` is repeated, which unnecessarily complicates the pattern.

### Example
```
fn main() {
    if let Some(0) | Some(2) = Some(0) {}
}
```
Use instead:
```
fn main() {
    if let Some(0 | 2) = Some(0) {}
}
```
