### What it does
Checks for transmutes that could be a pointer cast.

### Why is this bad?
Readability. The code tricks people into thinking that
something complex is going on.

### Example

```
unsafe { std::mem::transmute::<*const [i32], *const [u16]>(p) };
```
Use instead:
```
p as *const [u16];
```
